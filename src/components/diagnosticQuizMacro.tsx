    question: "If an economy's production possibilities frontier becomes steeper as it moves from point A to point B, this indicates that",
    options: [
      "resources are becoming more specialized",
      "the economy is becoming more efficient",
      "opportunity costs are increasing",
      "technology is improving",
      "resources are being underutilized"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "A steeper section of the PPF indicates that opportunity costs are rising because resources are becoming less adaptable to producing the alternative good."

      "Real GDP per capita",
      "Nominal GDP growth rate",
      "Total population growth",
      "Aggregate consumer spending",
      "National unemployment rate"

    id: 3,
    unit: 3,
    unitName: "National Income and Price Determination",
    question: "In an economy with a marginal propensity to consume of 0.8, if businesses increase investment spending by $50 billion, what is the maximum possible increase in equilibrium GDP, assuming no crowding out?",
    options: [
      "$40 billion",
      "$100 billion",
      "$200 billion",
      "$250 billion",
      "$400 billion"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",

    id: 4,
    unit: 4,
    unitName: "Financial Sector",
    question: "If a commercial bank has $100,000 in new deposits and the required reserve ratio is 10%, what is the maximum amount of new loans this single bank can create?",

      "$90,000",
      "$100,000",

      "$1,000,000"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "With a 10% reserve requirement, the bank must keep $10,000 in reserves and can lend out the remaining $90,000. This represents the maximum amount this single bank can lend from the new deposits."

      "Both will increase but by less than double"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "Due to the classical dichotomy and monetary neutrality in the long run, changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables. The price level will double while real output remains unchanged."

      "A decrease in tax rates",
      "An increase in transfer payments",
      "A decrease in interest rates",
      "An increase in interest rates",
      "A decrease in imports"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "Higher interest rates would lead to crowding out of private investment, reducing the size of the multiplier effect from the government spending increase."

    options: [
      "decreased unemployment",
      "a more effective Phillips curve trade-off",
      "reduced inflation expectations",
      "a self-fulfilling inflation cycle",
      "improved real wage rates"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "When workers build inflation expectations into wage demands, it creates a wage-price spiral that can perpetuate inflation, making it self-fulfilling."

    id: 13,
    unit: 1,
    unitName: "Basic Economic Concepts",
    question: "A small island nation currently uses all its resources to produce either coconuts or fish. If a new fishing technology is introduced that only affects fish production, the production possibilities frontier will",

      "shift outward only along the fish axis",
      "shift outward evenly along both axes",
      "become steeper at all points",
      "become flatter at all points",
      "shift inward along the coconut axis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "Since the technological improvement only affects fish production, the PPF will shift outward asymmetrically, with the fish axis extending further while the coconut intercept remains unchanged."
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    unit: 2,
    unitName: "Economic Indicators and the Business Cycle",

  {
    id: 16,
    unit: 4,
    unitName: "Financial Sector",
    question: "A central bank aims to reduce inflation. Which combination of monetary policy tools would be most effective?",

      "Raise reserve requirements and lower discount rate",
      "Lower discount rate and raise reserve requirements"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "To reduce inflation, the central bank would use contractionary monetary policy: raising the discount rate to discourage borrowing and selling government securities to reduce the money supply."

      "Aggregate demand",
      "Long-run aggregate supply",
      "Short-run Phillips curve",

      "Decrease due to relative price changes",
      "Remain unchanged due to sticky prices",
      "Decrease due to currency appreciation"

      "unemployed resources",
      "unlimited wants",

    id: 20,
    unit: 2,
    unitName: "Economic Indicators and the Business Cycle",
    question: "If nominal GDP increases by 8% and the GDP deflator increases by 3%, the real GDP growth rate is",

      "11%",
      "5%",
      "3%",
      "2.67%",
      "-5%"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Real GDP growth can be calculated by subtracting the inflation rate from nominal GDP growth: 8% - 3% = 5% real GDP growth."
  },

    unit: 3,
    unitName: "National Income and Price Determination",
    question: "A decrease in business taxes would most likely result in",

      "decreased aggregate demand and decreased aggregate supply",
      "no change in either aggregate demand or supply"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "Lower business taxes increase both aggregate demand (through increased business spending and investment) and aggregate supply (through lower production costs)."
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    unit: 4,
    unitName: "Financial Sector",
    question: "If people suddenly prefer to hold more currency relative to deposits, this will likely cause",

      "an increase in the money supply",
      "no change in the money supply"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "When people hold more currency relative to deposits, banks have fewer deposits to lend out, reducing the money multiplier and the banking system's ability to create money."

  {
    id: 23,
    unit: 5,
    unitName: "Long-Run Consequences of Stabilization Policies",
    question: "In an economy experiencing stagflation, which policy combination would be most appropriate?",

      "A factory adds to its inventory of finished goods"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The purchase of a used good (the classic car) is not counted in GDP because it was counted when originally produced. Only the dealer's markup (service) would be included."
  },
  {
    id: 26,
    unit: 3,
    unitName: "National Income and Price Determination",
    question: "When consumption increases by $400 billion following a $500 billion increase in disposable income, the marginal propensity to",

      "consume and save are both 0.5"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The MPC is calculated as change in consumption divided by change in disposable income: $400B/$500B = 0.8. Since MPC + MPS = 1, the MPS must be 0.2."
